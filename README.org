* Usage
  In the program, there is a reference to 'encoded result', which means the colours returned from wordle translated to numbers. A 0 is gray, a 1 is yellow, and a 2 is green. For example, if your letters are Grey, Yellow, Yellow, Grey, and Green respectively, you must enter 01102. Entering 22222, which indicates a winning word, ends the program immediately.
